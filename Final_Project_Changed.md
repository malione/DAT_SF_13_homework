## New Final Project -- Michael Malione

### Project Statement and Goal
My original Final Project turned out to be too difficult and time-consuming for the scope of this class. For this reason, I've decided to change my final project plan. Instead of doing the Kaggle competition for diabetic retinopathy, I've decided to do some data analysis and prediction on the Social Security baby names database.

The goal of this project is to depict the changing popularity of names over the course of time and, in the spirit of Freakonomics, to corroborate these data with other social media and leadership directories to predict the popularity changes of a particular name from year to year, along with the economic prospects associated with having a particular name. I'm still putting together my plan for this project, so it's very rough right now. I plan to create a learning model that will look at previous popularity trends in conjunction with a handful of search engine and social media compilations to predict how many children will be given that name in the following year. My goal is to predict the 2014 name popularities before they are released. I also plan to consider the economics prospects of a particular given name, looking at birth names from 20 to 60 years ago.

### What question or questions do I hope to answer?
The question I hope to answer is whether I can develop a learning model that predicts the SSA name rankings for a given year, starting with the prior historical data and a variety of readily-available data. For sake of the final project, getting such a system up and running, and going through the steps of training and validating it, will both be constructive experiences. I'm excited about the prospect of having new data coming available any week, which will be a good test of what I create.

### What data set do I plan to use, and how you will obtain the data?
The baby name data set is provided from the SSA websiste. I'm still deciding which corroborating data sources to use. I'm also debating whehter to do this at a statewide or national level, since the SSA provides both kinds of data. A big part of this project will entail goal selection, data sources, and feature engineering. Dependng on my source of data, there will be a varying degree of data munging required. My plan is to pick a second data source that provides me some experience with this particularly important aspect of data science.

### What type of machine learning problem is this? (from our 2x2 matrix)
This will be both a clustering problem and a regression problem. I plan to use clustering to identify particular kinds of naming trends, and regression to predict a number of metrics, starting with the predicted volume and ranking of any given name for a new year. So, this project will have both an unsupervised and a supervised component. I'm still determining which algorithm I'll need to use, as I'm still getting a feel for the data and the features involved.

### Why did I choose this project?
* Having just named my son, I'm interested in baby names.
* I remember reading the analysis described in Freakonomics, and I'm curious about it.
* I'd like to use that concept as a branching point for further exploration.
* I definitely want to try my hand at some predictive task.
* This project offers me plenty of options to pursue ideas that interst me and get some clear results.
