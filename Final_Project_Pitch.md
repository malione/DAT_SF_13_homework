### April 1: Final Project Elevator Pitch

The Final Project Elevator Pitch includes both a short (one paragraph) write-up of your proposed project topic and a concise (<90 seconds) presentation to the class. The elevator pitch should include:

* A concise statement of the goal of your project
* What question or questions you hope to answer
* What data set you plan to use and how you will obtain the data
* What type of machine learning problem this is (from our 2x2 matrix)
* Why you chose this project
